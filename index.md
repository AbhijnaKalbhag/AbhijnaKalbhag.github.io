> A step towards Ecommerce Functionalities in terms of APS

An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service [[1](https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/ecommerce-website/#:~:text=An%20e%2Dcommerce%20website%20is,logistics%2C%20and%20provide%20customer%20service)].

In this portfolio, I am trying to express the basic functionalities of an e-commerce website in terms of algorithms.

## Motivation
ðŸš€ The primary motivation behind this portfolio is to understand and demonstrate how various algorithms can be applied to enhance the functionalities of an e-commerce website.

## Objectives
ðŸ“Œ The objectives of this portfolio include:
- Exploring algorithmic solutions to common e-commerce problems.
- Demonstrating the implementation of these solutions.
- Analyzing the complexity and efficiency of the algorithms used.

## Architecture
